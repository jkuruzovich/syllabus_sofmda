# Strategic and Organizational Foundations of Managing in the Digital Age

Always check back here for updates on the readings of the week. 

## Week 1: Introduction to Research and the Subject of Digital Transformation

The goal of this first week is to try to discuss and understand what we do as researchers. While the details vary by disipline, the process and outcomes is quite similar. There are more readings this week than will be typical. The goal is not to read for the all of the details but rather try to skim for the main ideas and get an overall feel for the topic.

For an assignment, please indicate three meaningful takeaways you might bring into your future research activities. (3 short paragraphs, approximiately on page total. )
