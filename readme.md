## Week 1: Introduction to Research and the Subject of Digital Transformation

The goal of this first week is to explore what we do as researchers while providing a comprehensive overview of digital transformation, research objectives, and the overall scope of the course. While the details of research processes may vary across disciplines, the underlying goals and outcomes are often quite similar. This weekâ€™s readings are more extensive than usual, but the intention is not to delve into every detail. Instead, you should focus on skimming the material to grasp the main ideas and develop a broad understanding of the topics at hand.
